# TipXMR - The Livestream Tip Bot for OBS

(Under Development)

## The Goal

We want to provide an open source, non-custodial service for streamers all around the world to accept [XMR](https://www.getmonero.org) in their Streams and display some information about the donor.

This will allow for a censorship resistant income source, independent of the big players like Twitch, YouTube, PornHub and the like.

## How it works

As [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) is the most popular software for streamers, we use it to display information about the livestream donations. This is done by simply adding a browser source to the OBS scene pointing to an animation website.

For the user the process is as follows:

- Navigate to the tip website of the streamer :eyes:
- Entering a name and a message :speech_balloon:
- Paying an XMR address displayed on the website :money_with_wings:
- Wait for your message in the stream :computer:
